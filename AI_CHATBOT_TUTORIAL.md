## üöÄ Phase 1: Project Setup & Base Chatbot

### Step 1.1: Initial Setup

**AI Prompt to Use:**
```
I want to build an AI chatbot with RAG capabilities. Help me set up the Vercel AI Chatbot template as a starting point. Guide me through:

1. Cloning the repository
2. Setting up environment variables
3. Understanding the project structure
4. Getting it running locally

Please provide specific commands and explain what each step does.
```

**Expected Actions:**
- Clone Vercel's AI Chatbot repository
- Install dependencies with `pnpm install`
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
- Configure basic environment variables (OpenAI API key, database URL)
- Run `pnpm dev` and verify chat functionality

**Verification Steps:**
1. ‚úÖ Chat interface loads at `http://localhost:3000`
2. ‚úÖ You can send messages and get AI responses
3. ‚úÖ Authentication works (login/signup)
4. ‚úÖ Chat history persists between sessions

### Step 1.2: Architecture Analysis

**AI Prompt to Use:**
```
Now help me understand the existing codebase structure. I need to:

1. Map out the key files and their purposes
2. Understand how the chat API works
3. Identify where I'll need to integrate RAG functionality
4. Create a development plan for adding RAG

Please analyze the existing code and create a clear architectural overview.
```

**Key Files to Understand:**
- `app/(chat)/api/chat/route.ts` - Main chat API endpoint
- `components/chat.tsx` - Chat interface component
- `lib/db/schema.ts` - Database schema
- `lib/ai/providers.ts` - AI provider configuration

**Deliverable**: Document your understanding of the current architecture before moving forward.

## üèóÔ∏è Phase 2: RAG Infrastructure

### Step 2.1: Design Database Schema

**AI Prompt to Use:**
```
I need to extend the existing database schema to support RAG functionality. Help me design and implement:

1. KnowledgeBase table - to organize document collections
2. RAGDocument table - to store uploaded documents
3. DocumentChunk table - to store text chunks for vector search
4. Proper relationships and foreign keys

The existing schema uses Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL. Please provide the schema definitions and migration files.
```

**Key Considerations:**
- User isolation (each user owns their knowledge bases)
- Document status tracking (uploading, processing, ready, failed)
- Metadata storage (file names, sizes, MIME types)
- Vector database integration (store Pinecone IDs)

### Step 2.2: Set Up Vector Database

**AI Prompt to Use:**
```
Help me set up Pinecone for vector storage. I need:

1. Pinecone account setup and API configuration
2. Index creation with proper dimensions (1536 for OpenAI embeddings)
3. TypeScript utilities for vector operations (upsert, query, delete)
4. Metadata filtering for multi-tenant isolation

Provide code examples and configuration steps.
```

**Implementation Files:**
- `lib/rag/pinecone.ts` - Pinecone client and operations
- Environment variables for Pinecone API key and index name

### Step 2.3: Build Document Processing Pipeline

**AI Prompt to Use:**
```
Create a complete document processing pipeline that:

1. Accepts PDF, DOCX, and TXT files
2. Extracts text content from each format
3. Chunks text into searchable segments (1000 chars, 200 overlap)
4. Generates embeddings using OpenAI
5. Stores vectors in Pinecone with metadata
6. Updates database with processing status

Use proper error handling and async processing. Provide TypeScript implementations.
```

**Implementation Files:**
- `lib/rag/pipeline.ts` - Main processing orchestrator
- `lib/rag/embeddings.ts` - OpenAI embedding generation
- `lib/rag/chunking.ts` - Text splitting utilities

**Debugging Strategy:**
- Add comprehensive logging at each pipeline step
- Implement status tracking in database
- Test with small files first, then larger documents
- Verify vector storage with Pinecone console

---

## üîå Phase 3: API Development  

### Step 3.1: Knowledge Base CRUD API

**AI Prompt to Use:**
```
Create REST API endpoints for knowledge base management:

1. GET /api/knowledge - List user's knowledge bases
2. POST /api/knowledge - Create new knowledge base  
3. GET /api/knowledge/[id] - Get knowledge base details
4. PATCH /api/knowledge/[id] - Update knowledge base
5. DELETE /api/knowledge/[id] - Delete knowledge base

Use the existing API patterns from the codebase (NextAuth session, Zod validation, error handling). Include proper TypeScript types and ownership verification.
```

**Key Implementation Details:**
- Session-based authentication with ownership checks
- Zod schemas for request/response validation
- Consistent error handling with existing patterns
- Database queries using Drizzle ORM

### Step 3.2: Document Upload API

**AI Prompt to Use:**
```
Build document upload and management endpoints:

1. POST /api/knowledge/[id]/documents - Upload multiple files
2. GET /api/knowledge/[id]/documents - List documents with status
3. DELETE /api/knowledge/[id]/documents/[docId] - Delete document

Features needed:
- Multi-file upload with FormData
- File validation (type, size limits)
- Async processing with status updates
- Integration with document processing pipeline

Provide complete TypeScript implementation with error handling.
```

**Debugging Tips When AI Code Fails:**
1. **File Upload Issues**: Test with Postman/Thunder Client first
2. **Processing Failures**: Add console.log at each pipeline step
3. **Memory Issues**: Process files sequentially, not in parallel
4. **Database Errors**: Check foreign key constraints and data types

### Step 3.3: Integrate RAG into Chat API

**AI Prompt to Use:**
```
Modify the existing chat API to support RAG functionality:

1. Accept selectedKnowledgeBaseId parameter
2. Perform vector search when KB is selected  
3. Inject relevant document context into AI prompt
4. Maintain existing streaming response functionality
5. Handle RAG failures gracefully (fallback to regular chat)

Keep the existing chat API structure but enhance it with RAG capabilities.
```

**Critical Implementation Points:**
- Preserve existing streaming behavior
- Add vector search before AI generation
- Format retrieved context appropriately 
- Include source citations in responses
- Graceful degradation when RAG fails

---

## üé® Phase 4: UI Integration

### Step 4.1: Knowledge Base Management Interface

**AI Prompt to Use:**
```
Create a comprehensive UI for knowledge base management:

1. Page at /knowledge for managing knowledge bases
2. Create/edit/delete knowledge base functionality
3. Document upload interface with drag-and-drop
4. Document status display (processing, ready, failed)
5. File management with delete capabilities

Use the existing UI patterns (shadcn/ui components, Tailwind styling). Make it consistent with the rest of the application.
```

**UI Components to Build:**
- Knowledge base cards with stats
- File upload component with progress
- Document list with status indicators
- Delete confirmation modals

### Step 4.2: Chat Interface Integration

**AI Prompt to Use:**
```
Integrate knowledge base selection into the chat interface:

1. Add KB selector dropdown in chat header
2. Manage selectedKnowledgeBaseId state
3. Show selected KB in chat interface
4. Display document sources when RAG is used
5. Handle KB switching during conversations

Follow the existing component patterns and state management approaches.
```

**State Management Challenges:**
- useRef pattern for accessing current state in callbacks
- Proper cleanup when switching knowledge bases
- Loading states during KB operations

### Step 4.3: Error Handling & User Feedback

**AI Prompt to Use:**
```
Implement comprehensive error handling and user feedback:

1. Toast notifications for upload status
2. Loading states during document processing
3. Error recovery options (retry failed uploads)
4. Clear error messages with actionable steps
5. Progress indicators for long-running operations

Make the UX smooth and informative throughout the RAG workflow.
```

**UX Considerations:**
- Immediate feedback for user actions
- Progress indicators for async operations
- Clear error messages with next steps
- Optimistic updates where appropriate

## üõ†Ô∏è AI-Assisted Development Best Practices

### Effective Prompting Strategies

**1. Be Specific About Context:**
```
// Good
"I'm working on a Next.js 15 app with Drizzle ORM and need to add a new API endpoint that follows the existing pattern in /api/knowledge/route.ts"

// Bad  
"Help me create an API endpoint"
```

**2. Request Code in Chunks:**
```
// Good
"First, help me create the database schema for RAGDocument table, then we'll work on the API endpoint"

// Bad
"Build the entire RAG system for me"
```

**3. Ask for Verification Steps:**
```
"After implementing this, how can I test that it's working correctly? What should I check?"
```

### Debugging AI-Generated Code

**When Code Doesn't Work:**

1. **Start with the Error Message:**
   ```
   "I'm getting this TypeScript error: [paste error]. The code you provided is: [paste code]. How do I fix this?"
   ```

2. **Break Down Complex Problems:**
   ```
   "The document upload is failing. Let's debug step by step:
   1. First, help me verify the file is reaching the API
   2. Then check if the processing pipeline is working
   3. Finally, verify the database update"
   ```

3. **Compare with Working Examples:**
   ```
   "This new API endpoint isn't working, but the existing /api/knowledge/route.ts works fine. Help me compare and find the differences."
   ```

### Code Quality Verification

**Before Moving to Next Phase:**

1. **Run Type Checking:**
   ```bash
   npx tsc --noEmit
   ```

2. **Run Linting:**  
   ```bash
   pnpm lint
   ```

3. **Test Core Functionality:**
   - Can create knowledge base? ‚úÖ
   - Can upload document? ‚úÖ  
   - Can query with RAG? ‚úÖ
   - Does error handling work? ‚úÖ

4. **Performance Check:**
   - Are responses under 2 seconds? ‚úÖ
   - Do large files process without timeout? ‚úÖ
   - Is memory usage reasonable? ‚úÖ
